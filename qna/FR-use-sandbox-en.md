## Question
How to use the SandBox?

## Metadata tags
lang-en, market-fr, portal, PosCreator, PosDealer

## Answer
The sandbox is fully functional just like the live system of fiskaltrust. It can be accessed by using the URL https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.fr/. In the sandbox you can register your company just like you would in the live-system, the simple difference is: Itâ€™s only for learning and trying out the functions of the fiskaltrust.Portal without any legal obligations.

While communicating with the sandbox, the fiskaltrust.Middleware always sends an additional signature for each receipt, indicating the sandbox usage. Each receipt printed in sandbox-mode must show this signature.
